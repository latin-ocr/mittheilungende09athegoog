1885, p. 336ss Aphthonius had six times been prosecutor on·
nonae (cp. Diqest. 50, 4, 18, 35 Cod. Theodosi. 13, 9, 4).

The syntax in 5-9 is neglected: Ἀφθονίῳ, ὀ πολειτευσπὶμενος.

The name Flavia Basile proves that the inscription belongs
to the fourth century. The rare word παγαρχὴσας probably
refers to the papi of the Roman colonia. Παγαρχὲω seems to
occur only here: πάγαρχος and ’.τοιγαρχία are quoted.

name on the Roman fashion with a true praenomen than with
Franz as Amnon both arc consistent with the copy of Hamil·
ton. The nomen is doubtful: Ν]αιούι[ο]ν agrees perfectly with
all the indications on the stone. Νεούιοι occurs as a nomen at
Antiocheia Pisidiae, v. Sterrett, Epiqrapkicol Journey, p.162.

tt is unfortunate that the epithet or number after φυλῶν is
lost: these tribes belonged to the Greek city, and the inscrip-
tion is earlier than the Roman colonia (235).

vincial officers.

This inscription is probably Christian, on account of the
name Theodora, and of the fourth century.
