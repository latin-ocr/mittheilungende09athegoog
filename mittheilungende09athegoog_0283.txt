civilisation. On the other hand in Phrygia the mass of the
Christian inscriptions known belong to the period 200-350
A, D., and show a very different character. ln the Laodicean
inscriptions the church constitution is more developed than
in Phrygia: presbyters‚ deacons‚ deaconesseS, and anagnostai
occur frequently. Christian formulas are developed: ἡ ἁγία
τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐκκλησίαι ἔνθα nuntiasti-eti: δοῦλος Oen-3: οἰκέτης Oto-3:

Greek, though they eontain Greek words. The explanation
lies in a fact which 1 have frequently brought out. Under the
Empire Greek had not become the common language of the
country. Educated persons learned Greek, while the mass of
the people spoke the native language, Phrygian, Lycaonian.

Lycaonian was spoken3 probably in a frontier town both were
known. But inscriptions in the native langoages hardly exist¹,
