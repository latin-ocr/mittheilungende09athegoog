diverge from the main road at these two points. They appear
to have been called rei-sot of Laodicein, and an official called
πάγαρχος is mentioned in one of the inscriptions. Πάγος, the
Latin pagus, must have come into use under the empire, pro·
bably alter Laodiceia became a colonia.

The inscriptions of Ladik, Sei-ai, and Khadyn Khan may be
grouped together as all belonging to the state of Laodiceia.
Ι spent a ¹whole day at Ladik in June 1882, and copied 51
inscriptions: in 1886 1 spent a forenoon at Khadyn Khan and
copied 61 inscriptions, and then went on to Serai‚ where on-
the same evening and the following morning Ι copied 24 in·
scriptions. These 141 form a series extending from the second
to the-fifth century aster Christ.

Comparing these with the class of inscriptions common in
the cities of Phrygia proper,we see a much larger proportion
of late inscriptions in the Lycaonian city. lt is a rare thing
to find in Phrygia an inscription which can be certainly put
so late as the fourth century: at Laodiceia and at leonium
(C. 1. G. 3992, 3995 b, etc.) they are frequent. The name Au·
relius, if used as a praenomen, indicates a date later than 215
. A. D.‚ when the custom of employing this praenomen as a
mark οῖ citizenship became universal in central Anatolia (see
Journ. Heu. stud. 1883, p. 30): the use of Aurelius as a no-
men begins much earlier. The name Ἰούλιος became common
in the latter part of the third century: probably the founda-
tion οἳ Colonia Laodicea contributed to spread the use of the
name. The name Φλάῧιος became common in the beginning
of the fourth century (Φλαούιος, on the other hand, is very
much older), and in the latter partos the century we find Va-
lentinus, Valentilla. lt is remarkable that while all these na-
mes became popular, as soon as the emperors who bore them
came to the throne, Constantine, Constantine, and Constans
were not in ordinary use: apparently special respect and awe
attached to these names.

Not a single fact is recorded about the history of Laodiceia
or the origin oi its name. Geographically it belonged to Ly-
