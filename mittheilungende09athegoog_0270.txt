cao‚nia,'and its situation has all the character of a Lycaonian·
city: compare Barata (Bin Bir Kilisse)‚ whose situationqin a
nook ,of the hills isvery similar. ‘Under the·empire it was in·
cluded in the province of Galatia, and both Strabo aad Pto-³.
lemy reckon it to Lycaonia.When‚ about 297 Α. DJ, the pro-
vinces were reorganised‚ Laodiceia was inclued in Pisidia.

From inscriptions and colus it is possible to construet the
following sketch of the history 0f1.a0diceia under the empire.
1. Claudius granted it the title Claudiolaodicea: the title pro-
bably indicated some stage in the Roman organisation of Pi-
sidia aud Lycaonia, compare also Claudioseleuccia‚ Claudio·
derbe, Claudiopolis, Claudeiconium. 2. Coins and perhaps in·
scriptions begin under the Flavian dynasty. 3. ln the second
and.third centur-ies an imperial ,slave or freedman was· sta,-
tioned at Laodiceia as an agent of the fiscus: the same was
the case at Nakoleia. 1 cannot otherwise account for the unu-
sual number οῗ imperial slaves and freedmen mentioned in
the inscriptions of these two cities. inscriptions are certain in
this period. 4. Under Maximim Α. Ι). 235-8, Laodiceia he·
came a Roman colony with the title Julia Auspicata Claudio·
laodicea (Head, Hist. Num„ p. 596).

ln trying to exhibit. the inscriptions as exhibiting the cha-
racter of Graeco· Roman civilisation in this country, Ι begin

with the inscriptions which relate to the religion oi’ Laodiceia.
