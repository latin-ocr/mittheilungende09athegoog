Laodiceia Combusta, now Yorgan Ladik, was situated in
a semicircular nook among the hills looking out north and
north east across the vast level plain which stretches away to
tlte Salt Lake 'l'atta and the ltills of tlte Haimane. About
three miles north is the village Ser-ai, where abundant ‘reg

existence of an ancient town: here again a study of the· in-
scriptions suggests that the town was part of the state of Lao·
diceia. Hierocles places Sinethandos next to Laodiceia: the
probability is that this city was situated at Khadyn liban,
and that according to a frequent Byzantine castam, it was
raised to the rank of a city and bishopric in later time. ln-
scription no. 11 seems to show that it belonged to Laodiceia
as late as Α. D. 350: it became independent before Hierocles
(about Α. D. 530).

The village at Serai and the toan at Khadyn Khan derived
some inipoitance from their situation exactly on the line οἲ

the East to Apameia, Laodiceia ad Lycum, and Ephesus, This
road evidently went straight amose, passing about three mi-
